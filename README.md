Raspberry Pi
============

###Definition

The [Raspberry Pi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi) is a credit-card sized computer containing at least 1 USB slot, which can be used for any USB device containing a [linux](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) driver.  Since the inception of the Raspberry Pi ([model A](http://www.raspberrypi.org/products/model-a/)) in February 2012, there have been two additional models made available, the [model B](http://www.raspberrypi.org/products/model-b/), and the [model B+](http://www.raspberrypi.org/products/model-b-plus/).

The major schematic are as follows:

                | Model A       | Model B       | Model B+       |
---------------:| --------------|:-------------:| --------------:|
**Processor**   | 700 MHz       | 700 MHz       | 700 MHz        |
**RAM**         | 256 MB        | 512 MB        | 512 MB         |
**USB Ports**   | Single USB    | Dual USB      | Quad USB       |

Numerous *linux-based* operating systems can be run on the Raspberry Pi. The Rasbian is generally preferred, since it is tailored specific to the Pi.  Other operating systems such as Rice, Plan 9, and Arch is just as savy.  Though, not recommended, linux distributions such as Ubuntu will work.  Keep in mind, the requirements of such operating systems tend to require more resources than the Pi has to offer (so grab an older distro).
